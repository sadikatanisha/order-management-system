HTML & CSS: The application's core structure is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and visually pleasing interface.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS templates combined with Express power dynamic content rendering on the server side, facilitating order detail display.

Express (Controller): Express handles backend logic using the MVC controller, managing routes, middleware, and data interactions.

MongoDB (Model): MongoDB serves as the database system, storing and managing order data in accordance with the MVC model.

Views: EJS templates represent the views, presenting data to users and facilitating dynamic content rendering.
